# JSP-000404: verified partial Lean development

Published by GitHub account `jerrylijize1224-star`, from the project owner's AI-assisted Codex development.

Snapshot date: 2026-09-19. **This is not a complete solution or an award claim.**

This project studies JSP-000404 / Erdős 504, Blumenthal's maximum-angle
problem, in Lean 4 with mathlib. The intended full classification remains the
unproved proposition `Prize.JSP404.SendovClaim` in `Prize/JSP404/Target.lean`.
It is not presented as a theorem.

This update completes the four-point incidence classification, proves equivalence of both geometric cases to one symmetric local expression, and proves label-independent four-point set bounds. It does **not** complete the projective-gap interpretation or the full problem.

[Earlier 2026-09-18 snapshot](jsp404-partial-20260918.zip) is retained unchanged.

## Verified scope

- Actual Euclidean-plane definitions, monotonicity, general-position reduction,
  sharpness interfaces, and the exact values `alpha 3 = pi / 3` and
  `alpha 4 = pi / 2`.
- Binary-cover counting and conditional geometric direction-cover bounds.
- Two-centre capacity, three-centre capacity bounds in both parameter ranges,
  and their connection to actual triangle angles.
- Four-centre capacity bounds, separately for a triangle with an interior
  centre and a convex quadrilateral. Each case has an arithmetic proof and
  an interface deriving its angle data from actual Euclidean geometry.
- An exhaustive four-point geometric classification via Radon's theorem,
  and a common label-independent angle expression whose low- and high-band
  bounds follow for every four-point set with the stated actual angle cap.
  General position is derived from the cap, not imposed as a new hypothesis.

The four-centre results bound the corresponding sum of four powers of two by
`2^n` when `n <= t < n + 1/2`, and by `2^n + 2^(n-2)` when
`n <= t < n + 1`. Here `n >= 2`; each geometric structure records its precise
angle and incidence assumptions. These are intermediate capacity results,
not exact values for configurations consisting of four ordinary points.

Main declarations (namespace `Prize.JSP404`):

| Result | File / declarations |
| --- | --- |
| Exact four-point value | `FourPoints.lean`: `fourPoints_sharp`, `alpha_four` |
| Interior arithmetic | `FourCentreInterior.lean`: `InteriorAngleData.capacity_low`, `.capacity_high` |
| Interior geometry | `FourCentreInteriorGeometry.lean`: `InteriorFourGeometry.capacity_low`, `.capacity_high` |
| Convex arithmetic | `FourCentreConvex.lean`: `ConvexFourAngleData.capacity_low`, `.capacity_high` |
| Convex geometry | `FourCentreConvexGeometry.lean`: `ConvexFourGeometry.capacity_low`, `.capacity_high` |
| Exhaustive classification | `FourCentreClassification.lean`: `four_centre_geometry_cases_of_angle_bound` |
| Common local expression | `FourCentreLocalIndex.lean`: `InteriorFourGeometry.labelled_capacity_eq`, `ConvexFourGeometry.labelled_capacity_eq` |
| Point-set expression and bounds | `FourCentreCapacity.lean`: `fourCentreCapacity_eq_labelled`, `fourCentreCapacity_low`, `fourCentreCapacity_high` |

The independent counting arguments use floor inequalities and triangle-angle
identities, rather than assuming the maximizing exponent profiles in the
published induction. This describes the proof route in this development;
it is not a claim of mathematical novelty or first formalization.

## Remaining gaps

1. A uniform cyclic projective-direction-gap definition and its equivalence
   to the common four-centre angle expression. The expression is explicitly
   defined and bounded, but its point-cluster interpretation is not assumed.
2. The connection from generalized point-cluster sizes to their local capacities.
3. A valid general counting argument for five or more centres.
4. Full sharpness constructions and assembly of the arbitrary-cardinality theorem.

Some existing auxiliary theorems have explicit hypotheses that are not yet
established for the general construction; in particular see
`research/jsp404-maximal-centres.md`. No such hypothesis has been added to
`SendovClaim`. Computational experiments are discovery aids, not proofs.

## Reproduction and verification

Pinned Lean: `leanprover/lean4:v4.34.0`.
Pinned mathlib: `5ed2965256430c3649e86755f9576b54eca72435`.
All transitive revisions are recorded in `lake-manifest.json`.

Install [elan](https://lean-lang.org/install/), then run in the extracted
project root, preserving the supplied lock file:

```sh
lake exe cache get
lake build
lake env lean Prize/Audit.lean
```

The source project was checked with `./scripts/lake.sh build`, followed by
`./scripts/lake.sh env lean Prize/Audit.lean`; both exited successfully.
The wrapper only selects the locally installed pinned toolchain.
The included logs are `verification/build.log` and `verification/axioms.log`.
Build job counts include dependencies and are not counts of new theorems.
This snapshot has not received an independent external
review or a fresh-machine rebuild.

The audited theorem dependencies are only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
`Quot.sound`. The project Lean source contains no `sorry`, `admit`, added
axiom declarations, or `native_decide`. `MANIFEST.sha256` records the exact
snapshot contents, except the manifest itself. The archive hash is stored
beside the archive. A local hash is an integrity record, not an independently
certified publication timestamp.

The original root and audit also include a small JSP-000628 auxiliary module;
it is retained unchanged so this snapshot matches the checked project. No
complete result for that problem is claimed either.

The PR descriptions were inspected, but their complete proof packages were
not independently rebuilt here. This list is not an exhaustive priority
search. Elementary exact cases and several proof ingredients overlap with
existing work. Whether the particular four-centre formalization adds a new
contribution requires further comparison and review.

Historical mathematical conclusions belong to their original authors.
This local formalization and its auxiliary proof development were generated
with Codex assistance in the project owner's session and checked locally.
The code uses mathlib; third-party libraries are fetched through pinned
dependencies and are not bundled. No sole manual authorship, first discovery,
award eligibility, or exclusive right to the problem is asserted.

## Publication status

This repository publishes the 2026-09-19 standalone research snapshot. An earlier version
is public in [the project owner's repository](https://github.com/jerrylijize1224-star/jsp404-lean-partial),
at commit `317441dd29d7a4975be4a89dc7802be2567f86cb`.
The repository history records this revision separately from that earlier commit. The prize repository's
[current contribution rules](https://github.com/TheJustinSunPrize/awards/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
accept complete original-problem solutions, not intermediate formalizations.
This snapshot is therefore intended for the project owner's own repository,
not as a completed prize submission.
